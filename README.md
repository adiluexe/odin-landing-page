### What I struggled with on this project, so far

Messy Copywriting

- I did not think the copy through, will update this sometime, purely meant to practice my flexbox skills and complete this project asap

Content Overflow

- I don't know if this is the right word, but I had few issues with responsiveness. To some extent I thought things would be scaled automatically using flexbox, but it seems I failed that on some part.

- I made a quick fix by not explicitly stating the height and width. I keep using `(num)vh` with different sections. It was working great at 100% size but when I scale it down it overflows. Instead I replaced it with padding and that somehow fixed the overflow. I still don't know if that's right though, and that's what I need to figure out.
